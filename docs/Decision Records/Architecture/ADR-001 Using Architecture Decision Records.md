# ADR-001 Using Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We agree with the points made in the blog post
["Documenting Architecture Decisions"](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
by Michael Nygard.

## Decision

We will document our decisions. In disagreement with the blog post we wont use
full sentences or paragraphs where bullet points will get the point across.
They argue nobody reads large docs and then create a large doc.

Status should be at the top of the document so readers know sooner vs later if
it is worth reading.

We will separate Architecture and Technology Stack Decisions.
