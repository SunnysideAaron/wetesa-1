# ADR-004 Database Columns

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are some basic rules for database columns that if you don't choose correctly
from the beginning will F*** your team / project hard later.

## Decision

- table_id not id
- UUIDs for primary keys
- Date / Time Columns: ACTION_WORD_on (datetime, date, or time)
- Time columns will be of type timestamptz and UTC. User timezone in separate column if needed.

## Why / Notes

### table_id not id

tables id columns are named are "table_id" not "id" so that when doing joins the
developer knows the id's match and links are not on mis matched ids.

When joining multiple tables in complex queries it is far less confusing to have
joining column names match. TODO provide examples.

example should show aliased tables. and why on complex joins having column names
match maters.

### UUIDs for all id type primary keys

Simple incrementing integers make replication (scaling) difficult. Use of UUIDs
makes replication far easier.

    - "For example, consider using v7 if you are using UUIDs as database keys."
    - Would we ever want v7 of uuid? does postgress care? seems v4 is default in postgress. This needs deeper research.

### Date / Time Columns

ACTION_WORD_on (datetime, date, or time), ACTION_WORD_on_date (date no time),
ACTION_WORD_on_time (times without date.), ACTION_WORD_on_user_tz (timezone of user),
effective_start, effective_end

Examples:
created_on, created_on_user_tz

Most dates should _on and be datetime set to UTC. _on can be a date or a time if needed.
Only use _date and _time in name when there is a specific reason for both fields
to exist in the same table. _on is better than _at which might be confused for a
place where an action occurred **at**.

Don't use timetz for ACTION_WORD_time columns see:

### timestamptz and UTC

- [Postreges Wiki: Don't Do This](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don't_Do_This)
- https://community.spiceworks.com/t/zone-of-misunderstanding/928839
"you just SET TIMEZONE in the userâ€™s connection to the database, and timestamps
 will automatically come back in the appropriate time zone. Beats the heck out of
  messes like the PHPBB time zone code."

## Consequences



## Other Possible Options

ACTION_WORD_date, ACTION_WORD_datetime, ACTION_WORD_time (times without date.),
ACTION_WORD_datetime_user_tz (timezone of user), ACTION_WORD_time_user_tz (timezone of user)

Examples:
created_date, created_time, created_datetime, effective_start_date,
effective_end_datetime, created_time_user_tz

This just says what the column is. There is certainly an argument against
including column types in column names but perhaps this would be a good exception.

## Not an Option
- ACTION_WORD_at for a timestamp and ACTION_WORD_on for a date field - eg start_at or start_on?
  - No way a group of developers keep a mix straight.
