TODO
 - simplerr?, other error handling packages

customer id in route? or user login?

pagination
  - what if data changes between pages? / orginal query? ie data gets changed after initial pull. do we care?

starting expensive work
  then end point returns response "runing url" / status OK
  then comes back with url to check status of process
  so kicks off work. but doesn't do work.

can all (err Error) returns be named so don't have initialize?
