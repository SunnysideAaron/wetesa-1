# TSDR-1006 Documentation  

## Status

Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated or Superseded (list DR)

## Context

Choose how and what to document.

- OpenAPI 3?
- https://passo.uno/seven-action-model/
- code docs??
- db chart ?scrutinizer? spelling
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1iy3z19/can_anyone_tell_me_what_tool_was_used_to_produced/
- Hype for documentation?
  - https://github.com/gopherguides/hype?tab=readme-ov-file
  - is there a book about? or they used it to write books?


## Decision

- Will use wiki on redmine as a catch all for what doesn't get documented in the above.
- code comments should answer **why** "foo manages foo" is worthless.
- when documenting CLIs include full flags in examples. Single letter cli flags are not descriptive enough.
