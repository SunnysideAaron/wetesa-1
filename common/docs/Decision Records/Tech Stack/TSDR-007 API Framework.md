# TSDR-004 API framework (or not!)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

frameworks are a way to quickly package a set of solutions to common problems.
Allowing development to get going quickly.

## Decision

Use the standard library.

## Why / Notes

It is repeatedly recommended to not use a framework. Using the standard library
instead. Most frameworks in Go were developed before Go 1.22 (2024-FEB) added
better routing. Using them will lock code into their middleware and way of doing
things.

## Consequences

Having to build things from scratch takes longer.

## Other Possible Options

- Example tech stack from [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/15y5wiq/lets_say_you_want_to_build_a_go_rest_api_should/) Chi, connectrpc, sqlc, squirrel, 3rd party auth
Chi for routing and mixing, for JSON req-res, I'll use connectrpc. In case I need cookie auth or file upload I use Chi I'll go with connectrpc.com for the transport and application layer. You get the protobuf as API spec and you can also generate the client SDK. It works like twirp but complies with grpc. For db access I'll use SQLC, query is validated and faster than ORM layer. You can use query builder like Squirel for complex dynamic query Use 3rd party auth, so you don't spent too much time working on authentication

## Not an Option

- [Goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa) - Goa provides a holistic approach for developing remote APIs and microservices in Go.
  - Looked into goa. new user documentation / steps kept being painful. Everything just slightly not working and requiring troubleshooting. If new user experience is like that than can't trust code. May be willing to try again.
- [Huma](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/) - Framework for modern REST/GraphQL APIs with built-in OpenAPI 3, generated documentation, and a CLI.
  - Same issue as goa. Tutorial was working well until it didn't, couldn't troubleshoot and fix without time / pain.
- [ogen]()
  - Similar problem as goa. Intro docs are light and not complete. Had limited patience for documentation that wasn't working.
- [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)
  - Seems to just be special comments in code. Ie writing the api spec inline with the code. Not bad but doesn't save typing. That's just typing in the same place.
- [go-rest-api-service-template ](https://github.com/p2p-b2b/go-rest-api-service-template)
  - includes dependencies
  - readme has a bunch of good good links worth following.
- [ardanlabs](https://github.com/ardanlabs/service)
  - Seems a bit overly complex to use starting point for a basic example, but may be a good study example
