# ADR-100
# TSDR-100

## Status

Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated or Superseded (list DR)

## Context

format the slog output for human readability.

## Decision

Keep our home brew from Wetesa-0. At some point will have to fix it and make
more robust.

## Why / Notes

I had the feeling that there were all these slog pretty handlers out there. 

## Consequences

- **[slog-multi](https://github.com/samber/slog-multi)** - saving in case we want to log to multiple places down the road.
- [slogd](https://github.com/kaihendry/slogd) - slog with duration. with video https://youtu.be/IsPa11N5pzI

## Possible Options (short list)

- [devslog](https://github.com/golang-cz/devslog) - Format logs for development.
  - nice output. a bit too much color.
  - has some nice features like type flaging and only so many values in a slice.
  - does not output context attributes. would have to add that.

- [golog](https://github.com/primalskill/golog) - Development, discard and production handlers with sensible formatting.
- [logging](https://github.com/dusted-go/logging)
  - [Creating a pretty console logger using Go's slog package](https://dusted.codes/creating-a-pretty-console-logger-using-gos-slog-package)
  - [prettylog](https://github.com/sytallax/prettylog)
- [slog-formatter](https://github.com/samber/slog-formatter) - Common formatters for slog + helpers for building your own
  - seems like a lot there. but not widely used?

## Other Possible Options

- [ConsoleHandler](https://gist.github.com/wijayaerick/de3de10c47a79d5310968ba5ff101a19) - similar to Zap’s ConsoleEncoder
  - very small code
- [console-slog](https://github.com/phsym/console-slog) - Handler that prints colorized logs, similar to zerolog's console writer output without sacrificing performances.
- [humane](https://github.com/telemachus/humane) - a human-friendly (but still largely structured) slog Handler
- [klog](https://github.com/kubernetes/klog) - the text format used by Kubernetes. Provides klog output routing when using the main package’s logger and a simpler logger that just writes to stderr. Both slog/logr and go-logr/logr APIs are supported.
- [slogcolor](https://github.com/MatusOllah/slogcolor) - Color handler for log/slog.

- [slogjson](https://github.com/veqryn/slog-json) - Format using the upcoming **JSON v2** library, with optional single-line pretty-printing: https://github.com/veqryn/slog-json
- [slogor](https://gitlab.com/greyxor/slogor) - A colorful slog handler

## Not an Option

- [logf](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AndrewHarrisSPU/logf) - (attr {key} interpolation, rich tty output):  (uses lazy Handler stores: https://go.dev/play/p/psdD7KDF5fp )
  - not maintained?
- [standard library slog: Writing a handler](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@go1.24.1#hdr-Writing_a_handler) - we don't need to write our own.
  - [slgotest](https://pkg.go.dev/testing/slogtest@go1.24.1)

- [slogpfx](https://github.com/dpotapov/slogpfx) - Easily prefix your log messages with attributes from the log record.
  - old, low buzz


- [slug](https://github.com/dotse/slug) - a handler that prints colourful logs for humans
  - not maintained
- [tinted](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/tint) - colorized output
  - tried. our home brew is better.  
- [zlog](https://github.com/jeffry-luqman/zlog) - Handler that writes beautiful, human readable logs.
  - low buzz
- [zlog](https://github.com/icefed/zlog) - Human-friendly output like zap development, json structured logging with more features for slog.
  - low buzz
