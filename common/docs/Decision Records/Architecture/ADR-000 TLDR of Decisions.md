  - UUIDs for primary keys
  - Date / Time Columns: ACTION_WORD_on (datetime, date, or time)
  - Time columns will be of type timestamptz and UTC. User timezone in separate column if needed.
- ADR-003 Go Coding Standards
  - [Uber](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)
- ADR-004 Linters

  - [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) 
- ADR-005 CI/CD

- ADR-006 Automated Testing
  - Integration testing of API endpoints.
- ADR-007 Package Layout
  - We can do what ever we want. See ADR-010 Package Layout for more notes.
- ADR-008 Error Handling
  - wrap errors
  - stack trace will be handled by slog
  - msg will be context only. Do not include calling or called function names. 
  - Don't use words like "error", "failed", "went wrong" "error occurred", "problem found", "failed to ..." in error messages.

    - WARN (4) Create a ticket. Something is wrong and needs fixing. Properly handled errors are info not warn.
    - ERROR (8) Call someone NOW! Something is wrong and needs immediate fixing.
  - Allow changing log level at runtime.
  - Allow different log levels for different parts of the code.
