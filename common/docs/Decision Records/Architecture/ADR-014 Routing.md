# ADR-014 Routing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Needed:
- routing
- grouping routes
- middleware
- middleware chaining

## Decision

Standard library for routing. Adaptor pattern for middleware.

Will use the "http.MethodGet" etc constants.
 [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#pkg-constants)
This will allow the compiler to catch mistypes.

For now, choosing not to code a radix tree for routing.

## Why

Since Go 1.22 (2024-FEB) added ServeMux, better routing, and path parameters the
standard library is recommended by the community for routing.
This is further supported by the fact that many routers are now abandoned.

There are 4 ways to pass information between middleware / handlers:
[Sharing Values with Go Handlers](https://drstearns.github.io/tutorials/gohandlerctx/)
- setting middleware as a method of a type (possibly a struct)
- context
  - good for request scoped key value pairs. ie user id, session id, request id, etc.
- adaptor pattern - method parameter
  - breaks the (ResponseWriter, *Request) method call
- global variables
  - shame on you for considering globals.

## Consequences

Don't have support of other developers on framework. Don't get any of the other goodies the framework has baked in.
