# ADR-019 CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

It is common practice for projects to use CI/CD to enforce standards and best
practices.

## Decision

Not using CI/CD. Yet.

## Why / Notes

It's a whole ball of wax to learn and not necessary as a solo dev. If / When the
project starts to have multiple developers it will be added at that time.

## Consequences

Runs the risk of code going live that isn's properly tested.
